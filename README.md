# CatCraft-OOP-project-
This project is a text-based cat simulation game built in Python. It uses object-oriented programming (OOP) principles such as classes, encapsulation, and information hiding, combined with exception handling and random behavior, to simulate the life of multiple cats.

Players can feed, hit, or let their cats rest overnight, and observe how their actions affect the cats’ health, tameness, and survival.

# Key Concepts Demonstrated

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) — Use of classes, methods, and object attributes.

Encapsulation & Information Hiding — Private attributes (__variable) to prevent direct external modification.

Exception Handling — Raises errors for invalid actions (e.g., feeding or hitting a dead cat).

Randomization — Random chance determines whether a cat becomes tame when fed.

State Management — Each cat maintains its own state: health, tameness, alive/dead, and fish count.

String Representation — __str__() method for formatted, readable output of object status.

# How to Run

Clone or download the repository.

Ensure both files are in the same folder:

cat.py (contains the Cat class)

cat_craft.py (contains the game logic)

Run the game using:

cat_craft.py

Follow the prompts in the terminal to play!
